Performed as a part of the Machine Learning Hackthon in my company, this was a prediction algorithm to check if a client would commit fraud post signing up on our platform. My code and model had a 93% accuracy in doing the job and I had finished 4th in th Hackathon

I have only uploaded only the main.py and requirements file. The class algorithm have not been uploaded since they contain critical information.
